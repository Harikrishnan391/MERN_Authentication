# User Authentication with MERN Stack 

# Overview
This project involves implementing a robust user authentication system using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) combined with JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The goal is to create a secure and scalable authentication mechanism that ensures only authorized users can access protected resources.

## Technologies Used
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing user data.
- Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js to handle HTTP requests and middleware.
- React.js: A front-end library for building user interfaces.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for building the server-side application.
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): A standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object, used for authenticating users.
