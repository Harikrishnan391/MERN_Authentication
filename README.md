# User Authentication with MERN Stack 

# Overview
This project involves implementing a robust user authentication system using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) combined with JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The goal is to create a secure and scalable authentication mechanism that ensures only authorized users can access protected resources.
